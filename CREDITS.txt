Thanks for nickname 'rst' (@ www.raspberrypi.org/forums/) for sending me
a special patch for circle sample 4 (https://github.com/rsta2/circle) to fit
my needs for testing the exception handling of the stub.
Thanks for 'rst' also for doing some testing and helping me to understand
the mailbox between GPU and ARM.
